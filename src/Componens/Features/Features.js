                    without visibility into the progress being made by the other team, agents lose a lot of time in back-and-forth communications.
                    All context is lost, resolution becomes delayed and the quality of your service takes a hit.</h5>

                        With Parent-child Ticketing, the ticket is resolved only if every team completes the task assigned to them,
                        so that each internal team is accountable for their role, and the ticket can be resolved only if every team has played a role.</p>
